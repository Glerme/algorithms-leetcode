# 70 - You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps


class Solution:
    # Fibonacci
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

        return dp[n]
